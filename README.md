# DatingSite
I tried my hand at making a responsive dating website landsing page using HTML, CSS & JS. 
I had alot of fun making this as it was a completly new experience, initially I wanted to make this a multi-site page which would allow the user to sign up and then access their options for dating. 
This might be an option i add later on down the line as my JavaScript skills improve and as I start to learn Full-Stack developement.
